My PhD is part of the Environmental Entelligence CDT at the University of Exeter, UK. This PhD is financially supported by the UKRI and is undertaken on a full time basis. The PhD was started in September 2022 and is set to finish in September 2026.
My interests at the beginning of my PhD are varied, however my research previously has involved investigaions into bioclimatic classification schemes with modern day sensing and climate model data.
